Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D medieval/fantasy square location tiles suitable for a videogame overworld, a strategy game, boardgame-like visuals, or for your next RPG campaign!

- expands upon my basic terrain assets for those interested in making medieval-fantasy themed games
- 125 tiles (over 63 unique location types, some on different terrain types, some with multiple variations)
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that towers, mountains, and trees can overlap the tiles behind 
- can be used in a square grid or staggered faux-hex style grid 
- includes 44 road tiles (16 direction types with 2-4 variations per type)
- includes 228 "decor" sprites which can be placed on any background terrain texture (these include versions of the hex locations with the underlying terrain removed)

Location types included: 
- farmland (with burned versions); also includes silo, barn versions
- villages; includes wood, thatched-roof, and burnt-down versions
- many castle & stronghold variations, some ruined; some built of stone, some of wood
- pyramids, sphinx, lost city
- church, scriptorium, graveyard
- windmill, farms, granary
- marketplace, smithy, inn, cookhouse, warehouse
- forester's cabin
- walled city 
- mines, caves, gated dwarven mine
- stonehenge, temple, temple ruins
- halfling village
- necromancer's tower
- lava-filled cave
- elven lodge

All assets are included as individual transparent-background png files. The base tile size is 256x256 plus vertical overlap. Decor sprites are of arbitrary size, but generally smaller than the tiles. 

Roads

These have been named in the following format: [road piece type][direction bit key][variation number].

The road piece type is straightforward. The direction bit key gives a zero or one depending on if the road attaches to that direction in the order of NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST. So, for example, a straight east-west road would be "0011", while a t-junction connection to West, East, and South would be "0111". The variation number is included so that every piece of road of a certain type and direction doesn't look exactly the same.

If this is giving you trouble, feel free to drop me an email and I'll try to do a better job explaining it. Or, likely, it's simple enough to just look at the images and figure it out.


Usage:

These square-format terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out. You can make this a square grid or a staggered square grid to get a hex-grid like effect. NOTE: The roads are NOT build to work for a staggered hex-grid style  map. If this is getting in your way, drop me an email and I'll help you out.

Future:

Feel free to email me more ideas for tiles; I do update this set from time to time (eventually) and it's always nice to hear what people want. I may also roll off more specialized asset sets based on particular themes over time.

(BTW the most helpful thing you can do for me is leave a written review wherever you purchased these assets. More sales means I have more time to draw tiles. :)
